- **Creating Choropleth Maps from DataFrames with folium**
- **MicroProject: Exploring COVID-19 Data from GitHub**
- **MicroProject: A DataFrame of Your Weather Forecast**
- **Highest Mountains in the World**
- **MicroProject: Illini Football**

### Projects
The `projects/` directory contains larger, comprehensive assignments that integrate multiple data science concepts:

- #### **Project 1: Mosaic Project**
Created a photo mosaic application based on the code and instructions provided by the instructor. Implemented:
  - Color analysis and RGB value extraction from images
  - Average color calculation for image regions
  
- #### **Project 2: Stock Analysis & Undervalued Stock Detection**
Conducted data analysis on a dataset of major companies’ stocks, including price, earnings, market cap, and other financial metrics. Applied statistical and machine learning techniques to identify potentially undervalued stocks. Implemented:
  - Data Exploration & Cleaning – Loaded and prepared the stock dataset from Kaggle for analysis.
  - Descriptive Statistics – Calculated mean, median, standard deviation, range, and interquartile range for price, earnings/share, and market cap to assess financial health.
  - Data Visualization – Plotted the top companies by market cap and the cheapest stocks by P/E ratio to highlight potential investment opportunities.
  - Correlation Analysis – Identified relationships between price, earnings, and market cap to understand valuation trends.
  - Linear Regression Modeling – Predicted stock prices using dividend yield and earnings/share; flagged stocks with actual prices far below predicted as undervalued.
  - Hypothesis Testing – Applied t-tests to determine if undervalued stocks differ significantly in dividend yield or earnings/share compared to others.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Key Libraries**: pandas, matplotlib, numpy, PIL (Pillow), seaborn
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebooks

## How to Navigate This Repository

1. Each assignment is contained in its own directory with descriptive naming
2. Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files) contain the main analysis and code
3. Data files are included where permitted by course guidelines
4. Comments and markdown cells provide context and explanations throughout

## Academic Integrity

This repository serves as a portfolio of my completed coursework. All work contained here represents my efforts in accordance with the University of Illinois academic integrity policies. The upload of these course materials to GitHub has been approved by the professors.
